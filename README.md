Attempting to recreate the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

Here is my rendition of the [game](https://wordle-clone-26g.pages.dev).

## How I made the site
A large start to this project was done with the help of a tutorial made by [CoderCoder](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCoderCoder) where she helped with the basic functionality of the game itself and the asthetic of the game.

The rest of the game was done (or planned to be done) by me which includes components such as:
* An in-game keyboard for mobile functionality
* Checking if the input is actually a word
* Creating a list of words that can be included as solutions to the game
* A light/dark mode

This list may be changed in the future, but for now I am planning on doing everything in this list.

## What is my goal?
I want to try to replicate as much of the game as possible using skills that I have learned from tutorials and the years of experience I have as a programmer.
Once I feel that I have done a sufficient enough job, I will move on to try and create a website of my own (since that is a much taller task).

## Anything else?
I may or may not treat this README as a sort of journal entry to document my progress. It does not really matter because I will be logging things anyways. Other than that, this is really my first time working on a project that is not a tutorial (since following tutorials is easy) and I am pretty excited. I want to try to follow proper conventions when programming this thing since that is really important so I will try my best to learn how it is done in the real world and use concepts that I have already learned in the past. If you are reading this, thanks for stopping by and I am glad you really care (and if not, at least somewhat interested) about my journey to becoming a future developer!
